# The Future of Programming: Natural Language

The future of programming is leaning towards using natural languages like English, making it more accessible and intuitive. This approach is often referred to as **Natural Language Programming (NLP)**. 

In the context of the LLM revolution, programming and high-level languages like Python are likely to evolve in fascinating ways, blending traditional coding with new AI-driven approaches. Here are some trends which will happen in near future:

### 1. **Shift Toward AI-Assisted Coding**  
With LLMs becoming more integrated into the development process, developers will increasingly rely on AI as an assistant for coding tasks. Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT-powered IDEs already enhance productivity by suggesting code snippets, refactoring code, and generating boilerplate automatically. In the future, developers may spend less time writing low-level code and more time orchestrating AI agents to do the heavy lifting.

*Imagine debugging being as simple as asking your AI assistant to identify and fix issues, rather than pouring over lines of code for hours. That’s a future you might look forward to!*

### 2. **Higher Abstractions**  
Programming languages like Python, known for their simplicity and readability, will continue to thrive because of the need for high-level abstractions. However, developers may start interacting with code in a more natural, conversational way, where code generation becomes as easy as describing what you need.

*Python might become more like "English with curly braces" where even non-coders can build applications just by having a detailed conversation with their LLM.*

### 3. **Auto-Generated Codebases**  
LLMs might soon be able to write entire applications with minimal human intervention. Developers would focus on setting high-level objectives, and the AI would handle everything from selecting the architecture to writing and testing the code. This paradigm will turn programming into more of a supervisory role, overseeing AI-generated code rather than manually writing it.

*Programming might start feeling more like being the director of an orchestra than the violinist in the pit.*

### 4. **New AI-Oriented Programming Paradigms**  
Programming paradigms may shift toward a more declarative, goal-oriented model, where developers specify what they want rather than how to achieve it. For instance, you might simply describe a desired functionality, and the AI will produce the entire stack of code, optimize it, and even suggest improvements.

*No more stack overflow deep dives; just tell your AI assistant what the feature should do, and boom, it’s done!*

### 5. **Customized Programming Languages**  
The need for languages like Python may persist, but they could evolve with built-in capabilities to interact seamlessly with AI models. We might see specialized versions of Python or entirely new languages designed to work alongside LLMs, focusing on human-AI collaboration rather than just programming logic.

*Python 4.0 could come with a conversational interface, where the "interpreter" is literally interpreting what you want to achieve.*

### 6. **LLMs as Code Reviewers and Architects**  
LLMs could become integral not just for writing code but also for reviewing it. They may assist in automating the process of checking for performance optimizations, security vulnerabilities, and best practices. Additionally, AI could play a larger role in architectural decisions, suggesting the best frameworks, cloud services, or data models based on project needs.

*Imagine AI giving code reviews that don’t just say, “This is wrong,” but explain why and instantly provide a better solution. It’s like having a senior engineer in your pocket.*

### 7. **Impact on Education and Learning**  
As AI handles more coding tasks, learning how to code might change drastically. The focus may shift from memorizing syntax to understanding system design, AI integration, and advanced problem-solving. Python and similar languages may be taught more as tools to communicate with AI systems rather than direct programming languages.

*You might not need to worry about forgetting a specific function—you’ll just ask your AI assistant to “do that thing with the JSON again!”*

### 8. **Hybrid Roles**  
Programming might morph into a hybrid role combining traditional development with machine learning, data science, and AI orchestration. Developers will need to know not only how to code but also how to effectively train, fine-tune, and deploy AI models, integrating them with regular applications.

*In the future, “I’m a Python developer” might mean you’re just as comfortable coding as you are tuning a GPT model for a specific task.*

In conclusion, while programming languages like Python will remain important, the way we interact with them will transform. AI will simplify, augment, and even replace certain aspects of programming, but developers will still need to understand the underlying logic, principles, and architecture to truly leverage the power of AI-driven development.

## Prompt: I suspect that in near future some form of new custom english like programming language will appear which will act as a intermediary language which in turn will be generating Python like programing languages

I completely agree with your suspicion, and it aligns with how the field of programming is evolving in the context of AI and LLM advancements. In fact, we're already seeing signs that a custom, English-like intermediary language could emerge to bridge the gap between human instructions and machine-executable code, acting as a high-level interface for generating more structured languages like Python, JavaScript, or even cloud infrastructure code.

Here’s how such a future might unfold:

### 1. **The Rise of Conversational Programming Languages**  
We could witness the creation of a new "Natural Programming Language" (NPL), which would be a simplified, human-readable language much closer to natural English. This language wouldn't be designed for direct machine execution but instead serve as a layer that AI models would interpret to generate actual executable code in Python, JavaScript, or other languages based on the context.

*Imagine telling your AI: “Create a microservice that stores user data in a PostgreSQL database and exposes a REST API for data retrieval,” and it seamlessly translates that into a FastAPI service with all the relevant endpoints and database connections.*

### 2. **Domain-Specific Intermediary Languages**  
These intermediary languages could also be tailored for specific domains. For example, you might have a version of this "NPL" for web development, data science, AI model training, or even Kubernetes infrastructure. Each would let developers describe tasks in domain-specific, plain language, which the AI would parse and translate into detailed code.

*Instead of writing Kubernetes YAML manifests by hand, you'd simply say: “Deploy a scalable web app using Python and PostgreSQL on Kubernetes,” and the system would generate all the necessary Kubernetes configurations, Helm charts, and deployment scripts.*

### 3. **AI-Generated Python from NPL**  
The Python-like language would still be generated behind the scenes because high-level, flexible, and widely supported languages like Python are excellent for actual implementation. The intermediary NPL would allow developers to specify requirements, and then the AI would generate well-structured, idiomatic Python code to meet those requirements.

*You could think of the new intermediary language as the "high-level architect," and Python as the "construction worker" that turns the blueprint into reality.*

### 4. **Code as Dialogue: Multi-Step Commands**  
This new form of intermediary language might allow for multi-step "dialogue coding." You could iteratively refine the program's behavior through conversational instructions, with the AI asking for clarifications or suggesting improvements. For example, you might begin by specifying a task in broad strokes, and the AI would ask for specifics:

- You: "Create a data pipeline that ingests CSV files, processes them, and stores them in a database."
- AI: "Should I use Pandas for processing and PostgreSQL for the database?"
- You: "Yes, also make sure it runs as a scheduled job every hour."
- AI: "Should I set up a CRON job, or would you prefer using a cloud-native scheduler like AWS Lambda?"

*In this case, the human works at a high conceptual level, and the AI handles the translation into detailed executable code.*

### 5. **Interactive Code Generation and Execution**  
Intermediary languages might also offer real-time execution and feedback loops, where the AI generates the Python code, runs it, and provides results or error reports immediately. This would enable a highly interactive development process where you could issue high-level commands, and see the results almost instantly, adjusting as needed.

*Instead of writing an entire script, you’d write a "description," let the AI generate code, execute it, and show you what went right or wrong. Coding becomes an interactive conversation with the machine.*

### 6. **Lowering the Barrier for Non-Programmers**  
A custom English-like intermediary language would dramatically lower the barrier to entry for people who aren't traditional programmers. Many people with domain expertise but no programming background could describe their requirements in this intermediary language, and the AI would handle the conversion to Python or any other relevant language.

*Think of small business owners describing their automation needs in plain English and getting full software solutions delivered without hiring a development team.*

### 7. **Natural Language Processing Integration**  
This intermediary language could be further enhanced by NLP integration, allowing the AI to infer meaning, handle ambiguity, and ask intelligent follow-up questions. If a command is unclear or incomplete, the AI would act as a "programming coach" to clarify intent before generating the code.

*Imagine a scenario where you say, “Build an e-commerce website with a user login system,” and the AI follows up with, “Should I use OAuth for login authentication, or would you prefer a simpler email-based login?”*

### 8. **Code Customization through Plain-English Descriptions**  
Once the AI generates the initial Python code, developers could fine-tune or add custom functionality using this intermediary language. Instead of modifying the code directly, they could describe changes in English-like syntax, and the AI would update the generated codebase accordingly.

*For example, “Add an API rate limiter to the login endpoint, limiting users to 5 login attempts per minute,” and voila, the Python code gets updated with a Flask or FastAPI rate-limiting middleware.*

### 9. **Open-Source Language Evolution and AI Collaboration**  
Given the open-source nature of many AI and programming frameworks, it's likely that developers would continuously evolve and customize this intermediary language. Communities could create and refine different dialects or libraries that make these tools even more powerful for specific use cases, allowing for a more collaborative evolution.

*Python and this new intermediary language could coexist and evolve together—one handling low-level logic and the other governing high-level functionality.*

### 10. **Natural Language Debugging and Refactoring**  
Not only would this intermediary language serve to generate code, but it could also assist with debugging and refactoring. You might say, “Optimize the database queries in this service,” and the AI could analyze the Python code it generated, then automatically refactor it to be more efficient, explaining the changes in plain English.

*Debugging wouldn’t be an exercise in hunting down bugs, but more like talking to an AI: “Why is this part of the code slow?” and the AI would provide answers and fixes in one go!*

In this AI-assisted programming future, **Python and similar languages will still play a crucial role**, but they'll be abstracted away from direct user interaction, becoming the execution layer beneath a new wave of natural, conversational programming interfaces.
