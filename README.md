# Learn Cloud Native Modern Python

This repo is part of the [Certified Cloud Native Applied Generative AI Engineer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15usu1hkrrRLRjcq_3nCTT-0ljEcgiC44iSdvdqrCprk/edit?usp=sharing) program. It covers the first quarter of the course work:

## Quarter 1: Fundamentals of Prompt Engineering, Docker, GitHub, and Modern Python Programming

We begin the course by understanding the basics of GenAI and Prompt Engineering. Then we will understand the basics of Linux, Docker, VSCode, Devcontainer, and GitHub. The main focus will be on mastering the fundamentals of Modern Python with Typing, the go-to language for AI.

Note:

Docker has market share of 82.63% in containerization market. GartnerÂ® estimates that 90% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production by 2026.
